1.	Purpose

I. Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.

II. Use D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.

II. Parse data in JSON format.

IV. Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.

V. Use JavaScript's Math library to manipulate numbers.

VI. Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.

VII. How to use interactivity to enhance your visualizations.

VIII. Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages.

2.	Overview

Using bacterial data collected from volunteers, the goal is to complete a dashboard panel with demographic information. Specifically, the volunteers can identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.

Analysis and Challenges

I.  Only the top ten most commonly found bacteria in a person's belly button was displayed

II.  Each of her volunteers carries a variety of bacterial species in his or her belly button.

III. There is also information on the number of bacteria found for each species. The dashboard Roza has in mind has display the most common bacterial species, by count, in the navel.


3.	Recommendations

I. When looking for people who carry a large number of a certain bacterial species, Roza's volunteers should be able to quickly use the dashboard to figure out whether they are eligible to sell their bacteria to the company.

II. Analysis as to the overall most common culture of bacteria should be provided.
